/*
When a method output an array we can use chaning method such as Filter and Map return an array
Whereas Reduce return a value so after reduce we can't use chaning method. 
PIPELINE analogy
ðŸ‘‰ Try to avoid overly complex chains specially in a larg arays as it's a serious performance concern
ðŸ‘‰ Although it's allowed to use mutated methods in chaining but it's a bad practice in JavaScript
